## Project: Pub/Sub to BigQuery Data Transfer Using Dataflow

### Description

This project demonstrates the end-to-end data pipeline for transferring streaming data from Google Cloud Pub/Sub to Google BigQuery. It utilizes Apache Beam with Google Cloud Dataflow to facilitate this data transfer. The project includes two setups for running the Dataflow pipeline: Direct Runner and Dataflow Runner.

### Components

- **Google Cloud Pub/Sub**: A messaging service that ingests streaming data.
- **Google Cloud Dataflow**: A fully managed service for stream and batch data processing.
- **Google BigQuery**: A serverless data warehouse for querying and analyzing large datasets.

### Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Data is ingested into Google Cloud Pub/Sub topics.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - **Apache Beam** is used to define a data processing pipeline that reads messages from Pub/Sub and writes them to BigQuery.
   - The pipeline is defined in Python, using Apache Beam's SDK.

3. **Execution**:
   - **Direct Runner**: Used for local development and testing. Processes data in a single machine environment.
   - **Dataflow Runner**: Used for running the pipeline in the cloud. Handles large-scale data processing and scaling.

4. **Data Storage**:
   - Processed data is written to a Google BigQuery table.

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the required Python packages installed. You can do this using:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Google Cloud**:
   Set up your Google Cloud project, and ensure you have the necessary IAM permissions for Pub/Sub, Dataflow, and BigQuery.

4. **Run the Pipeline**:
   - **Direct Runner**:
     ```sh
     python your_pipeline_script.py --runner DirectRunner --project your-project-id --temp_location gs://your-bucket/temp/
     ```
   - **Dataflow Runner**:
     ```sh
     python your_pipeline_script.py --runner DataflowRunner --project your-project-id --temp_location gs://your-bucket/temp/ --staging_location gs://your-bucket/staging/ --region your-region
     ```

### Configuration

- **Pipeline Script**: `your_pipeline_script.py`
  - Contains the Apache Beam pipeline definition.
  - Configures Pub/Sub subscription and BigQuery table details.

- **Requirements**: `requirements.txt`
  - Lists Python dependencies required for running the pipeline.

### Usage

- Modify the pipeline script to adjust Pub/Sub topics, BigQuery tables, and any additional processing logic.
- Execute the pipeline using the appropriate runner for development (Direct Runner) or production (Dataflow Runner).

### Notes

- Ensure you replace placeholders such as `your-project-id`, `gs://your-bucket/temp/`, and `your-region` with your actual values.
- Review the permissions and quotas for Google Cloud services to avoid any issues during execution.
